\abstract{% Abstract of the article
Object-oriented programming (OOP) languages allow for rich creation of new types through, for example,
the \begin{em}class\end{em} mechanism found in C++ and Python (among others).

These techniques, while certainly rich in the functionality they provide, addtionally require users
to develop and test new types; while resulting software can be elegant and easy to understand (and
indeed those are some of the hopes behind the OOP paradigm), there is a cost associated to the addition
of the new code required to implement such new types. Such a cost will typically be at least linear
in the number of new types introduced.

One potential alternative to the creation of new types through \begin{em}extension\end{em} is the
creation of new types through \begin{em}restriction\end{em}; in appropriate circumstances, such
types can provide the same elegance and ease of understanding, but without a corresponding linear
development and maintenance cost.
