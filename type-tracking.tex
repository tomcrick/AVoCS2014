\abstract{% Abstract of the article
One of many common artefacts of complex software systems that often needs to be tracked through
the entirety of the software system is the underlying type to which numerical variables refer.

Commonly-used languages used in business provide complex mechanisms through which general objects
are associated to a given type: for example, the \begin{em}class\end{em} (and \begin{em}template\end{em})
mechanisms in Python (and C++) are extremely rich mechanisms for the construction of types with 
almost entirely aribtrary associated operation sets.

However, one often deals with software objects that ultimately represent numerical entities corresponding
to real-world measurements, even through very standardised SI units: metres per second, kilogram metres
per second-squared, etc.  In such situations, one can be left with insufficient and ineffective
type-checking: for example, the C \begin{em}double\end{em} type will not precent the erroneous addition
of values representing speed (with SI units \begin{em}metre per second\end{em}) to values
representing mass (SI unit \begin{em}kilogram\end{em}).

We present an addition to the C language, defined through the existing \begin{em}attribute\end{em}
mechanism, that allows automatic control of physical types at compile-time; the only requirement is
that individual variables be identified at declaration time with appropriate SI (or similar) units.
